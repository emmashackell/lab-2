<h1> favorite thing that I have read lately would be a book called "5 survive" </h1>
<p>The book is a survival thriller following the lives of 6 teenagers who spend the night stranded in an RV.
The book is about 400 pages, but it had short chapters so it didnt feel daunting to read.
I read the book last month and it is one of my new favorite books.</p>
